The format T should have the following interface:

// Values are stored as an array of length 'dimensions' of this type.
T::Type

// The alignment that values should be stored with. A value of zero signifies that it is unimportant.
T::ALIGNMENT

// A function that stores an inserted value in an array of the specified storage type.
// The array is of length dimensions.padded, which is greater or equal to the dimensions of the dataset.
// This	function is implemented for each possible input value.
void T::store(const U&, T::StorageType*, DatasetDimensions dimensions)
